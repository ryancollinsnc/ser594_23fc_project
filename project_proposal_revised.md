Keywords: 
1. Housing Market Analysis
2. Machine Learning
3. Predictive Modeling
4. *Data Visualization in Real Estate*
5. *Explainable AI in Housing Prediction*

Description: 

*This project aims to use machine learning and data science to assess and forecast house values using data collected from Zillow, a leading real estate marketplace. The research intends to construct a prediction model that may serve as a beneficial tool for potential house buyers, real estate professionals, and policymakers by diving into a vast dataset including numerous property qualities and their related pricing.* In order to create a forecast model for home prices, I intend on investigating real estate data in this project. Property characteristic including year build, house area, street, and other attributes are among the main types of data to be examined. What variables have the most effects on home prices in the chosen area, for example,
1. Can we create a model that uses a collection of well-known characteristics to forecast property values with accuracy?
2. What are some ways that prospective house buyers may utilize this model to make wise choices?

Intellectual Merit: 

*This research sits at the crossroads of data science, machine learning, and real estate market analysis. The project attempts to untangle the complicated dynamics of the housing market using modern machine learning algorithms and data analytic techniques, offering insights into the elements that influence home prices. This project's prediction model will not only add to academic knowledge of real estate market patterns but will also provide practical solutions and tools for diverse stakeholders. Furthermore, the initiative offers up new opportunities for future research, such as using deep learning techniques to improve forecast accuracy and exploring additional data sources to extend the dataset.* By using data science to develop a platform that may assist stakeholders (including house purchasers, real estate agents, and policy makers) in making data-driven decisions, it aims to increase knowledge in the real estate industry. The research might be expanded for graduate students to include deep learning analytics for predicting market patterns, adding new information to the subject.

Data Sourcing:

*This project's dataset was obtained using web scraping from Zillow, ensuring access to current and complete real estate data. The web scraping procedure entails accessing the Zillow website programmatically, pulling pertinent property information, and organizing it into a useful dataset. The data will then be rigorously preprocessed to deal with missing values, outliers, and inconsistencies. Then, exploratory data analysis (EDA) will be performed to acquire insights into the data distribution and find potential patterns or trends.*
