Keywords: 
1. Housing Market Analysis
2. Machine Learning
3. Predictive Modeling

Description: 
In order to create a forecast model for home prices, I intend on investigating real estate data in this project. Property characteristic including year build, house area, street, and other attributes are among the main types of data to be examined. What variables have the most effects on home prices in the chosen area, for example,
1. Can we create a model that uses a collection of well-known characteristics to forecast property values with accuracy?
2. What are some ways that prospective house buyers may utilize this model to make wise choices?

Intellectual Merit: 
This initiative has the ability to shed light on previously unknown variables that have a substantial impact on home values and offer fresh perspectives on the dynamics of the housing market. By using data science to develop a platform that may assist stakeholders (including house purchasers, real estate agents, and policy makers) in making data-driven decisions, it aims to increase knowledge in the real estate industry. The research might be expanded for graduate students to include deep learning analytics for predicting market patterns, adding new information to the subject.

Data Sourcing:
This project will use data from Kaggle, a website recognized for offering a variety of datasets in many fields. We will specifically make use of a dataset that includes thorough details on property features, including but not limited to location, house type, and other amenities, as well as their associated costs. We picked this platform since it is simple to use and has a large range of data that we can use to build a complex and in-depth prediction model.
